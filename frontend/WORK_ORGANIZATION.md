## 📁 File Organization Template

When creating new pages, follow this structure:

```
src/app/
├─ [page-name]/
│  └─ page.tsx                 # Main page component
│
src/components/
├─ [type]/                     # atoms/molecules/organisms
│  └─ [ComponentName]/
│     ├─ [ComponentName].tsx
│     ├─ [ComponentName].stories.tsx
│     └─ index.ts
│
src/pages-stories/
└─ [PageName].stories.tsx      # Page story for Storybook
```

---

## 🎨 Component Creation Checklist

For each new component:

- [ ] Create component file with TypeScript
- [ ] Export Props interface
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Make it responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Create Storybook story with variants
- [ ] Add to barrel export (index.ts)
- [ ] Document in COMPONENTS.md
- [ ] Test in Storybook
- [ ] Test in actual page

---

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Option A: With Mock Data (Current)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run storybook  # View components
```
✅ **Currently Active** - The explore page now shows 6 mock chefs!

### Option B: With Real Backend
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend services
cd backend
# Follow backend setup instructions

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd frontend
# Change USE_MOCK_DATA to false in src/lib/mockData.ts
npm run dev
```
